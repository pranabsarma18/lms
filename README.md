# 🗂️ Leave Management System (LMS)

The **Leave Management System (LMS)** is a web-based application built with **Django** to streamline the process of managing leave applications of employees within an organization.  

Traditionally, leave applications in many government offices (including those in Assam) are still handled manually through pen and paper, which is inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to errors.  

This project digitizes the process by providing a user-friendly web application where **employees can apply for leave online** and **administrators (HODs) can efficiently manage these requests**.

- Simplify the leave application process for employees.
